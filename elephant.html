        Elephants are the largest land animals, known for their intelligence, strong family bonds, and incredible memory. 
        They use their trunks for eating, drinking, and even showing affection. Found in Africa and Asia, these gentle 
        giants play a crucial role in their ecosystems by shaping landscapes and spreading seeds. Despite their size, 
        elephants are surprisingly agile and can communicate through low-frequency sounds. Unfortunately, they face threats 
        from habitat loss and poaching, making conservation efforts essential.
