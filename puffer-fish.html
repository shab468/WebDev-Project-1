        Pufferfish are fascinating marine creatures known for their ability to inflate into a 
        spiky ball when threatened. They contain a potent toxin called tetrodotoxin, which makes 
        them highly poisonous to predators and even humans. Found in tropical and subtropical 
        waters, pufferfish come in various sizes and vibrant colors. Despite their deadly defense 
        mechanism, some species are considered delicacies in Japan, requiring expert preparation. 
        These quirky fish showcase the incredible adaptability of ocean life.
