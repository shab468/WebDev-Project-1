      Panda bears are beloved for their black-and-white fur and playful nature. Native to China, 
      these bamboo-eating bears spend most of their time munching on leaves and climbing trees. 
      Unlike other bears, pandas do not hibernate, relying on their thick fur to stay warm year-round. 
      Conservation programs have helped increase their population, though they remain a vulnerable 
      species. Their charming appearance and peaceful demeanor make them a global symbol of wildlife preservation.
